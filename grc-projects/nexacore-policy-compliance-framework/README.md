# NexaCore – ISO 27002:2022 Policy Compliance Framework

## Executive Summary

This project involved contributing to the design and implementation of a comprehensive Policy Compliance Framework aligned with ISO 27002:2022. The objective was to address compliance gaps, formalize policy governance, and enhance security oversight in preparation for certification readiness and regulatory scrutiny.

The sprint resulted in the structured development of 10 core security policies covering high-risk domains identified through risk assessment.


## Governance & Ownership Model

A formal ownership structure was established to eliminate accountability gaps:

- Defined Policy Authors and Domain Owners
- Structured document control pages for versioning and review cycles
- Assigned accountability across departments to support governance maturity
- Proposed executive sponsorship and board-level reporting alignment

This reinforced transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.


## ISO 27002:2022 Control Mapping

All developed policies were mapped to ISO 27002:2022 domains and control areas, including:

- Organization of Information Security (5.1)
- Access Control & Privileged Access Management (5.4, 5.18)
- Secure Configuration (8.9)
- Incident Management (8.16)
- Backup & Disaster Recovery (8.14)
- Security Awareness & Training (6.3)
- Third-Party Risk Management (5.19)

This ensured traceability between governance documentation and international security standards.


## Compliance Monitoring & Risk-Tiered Approach

The framework introduced structured monitoring cadences:

- Monthly assessments for high-risk controls
- Quarterly validation activities
- Annual policy review cycles

A risk-tiered implementation model prioritized high-impact domains such as privileged access and sensitive data protection.


## Continuous Control Monitoring & Automation Strategy

To transition from manual compliance tracking to continuous assurance, the framework proposed:

- Automated evidence collection
- Integration with ticketing systems for remediation tracking
- Real-time compliance dashboards
- SIEM-integrated policy violation alerts
- Centralized evidence repository for audit readiness

This reduced audit preparation overhead and improved proactive risk management.


## Third-Party Risk Management Enhancements

A vendor risk classification model was introduced:

- Annual assessments for high-risk vendors
- Biannual reviews for medium-risk vendors
- Annual contractual validation for low-risk vendors

Standardized workflows reduced onboarding security assessment time while strengthening oversight.


## Impact & Strategic Value

This framework positioned the organization to:

- Improve audit readiness
- Reduce compliance fatigue
- Strengthen governance accountability
- Accelerate ISO 27001 certification alignment
- Enhance cross-functional security integration
